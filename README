Tk::TextHighlight.pm is a modified / derived version of the no longer maintained 
Tk::CodeText module, by Hans Jeuken.  Thank you Hans for doing the hard work in 
creating a really cool module.  CodeText was built on the Tk::TextUndo 
widget with capabilities of syntax highlighting.  Several formats are supported, namely 
Perl, HTML, Javascript, and Bash.  I (Jim Turner), have added several features:

1)  Added ability to also use the Syntax::Highlight::Engine::Kate highlighing 
engine and thus now supporting the many, many languages it supports.

2)  Tk::Text::SuperText - like bracket highlighting / matching with vi-like 
jump-to-matching bracket (Ctrl-p).

3)  Added feature to auto-change rules-colors for rules whose color is the same as 
the background color of the widget (to avoid invisible text).  The color is set to 
either black or white depending on the brightness of the background color.

4)  Fixed TextUndo-related bug to allow user to see text as he types past right-edge 
of screen.

5)  Added "setRule()" method to allow altering of individual rules by the programmer.

6)  Modified right-click menu to allow saving of modified rules.

7)  Added new options:  -noRulesMenu (dont show rules-menu in right-click menu), 
-noSyntaxMenu, -noRulesEditMenu, -noSaveRulesMenu to prevent the corresponding items 
from appearing in the right-click menu.  -noPlugInit - disables new feature #8 and 
behaves as original CodeText.

8) Fixed small bug w/auto-indenting.

9) Fixed small bug w/rules-initialization when no .rules file present.

10) Created a "Readonly" version called ROTextHighlight that works the same way but 
is based on Tk::ROText and is read-only.

The highlight mechanism however, is of a plugin-type. Adding additional 
languages should be a matter of writing Tk::TextHighlight::MyLanguage modules.

The perl syntax module is based on and requires either 
Syntax::Highlight::Perl or Syntax::Highlight::Perl::Improved.  It will attempt 
to use Perl::Improved first if it is available, failing that, 
Syntax::Highlight::Perl will be used.

The PerlCool module was written by Jim Turner and is derived from the Perl 
syntax module, but uses mustly "cool" colors, ie. blues, greens, violets, etc.
instead of the "warm" colors that the "Perl" syntax module uses.

This is the initial release. It has been written and tested on a
linux machine, though I have used it on some earlier versions on some 
m$-based machines.  Please try it out on those machines and report your 
findings back to me.

Not that you didn't know, but you install it like this:

	perl Makefile.PL
	make
	make test
	
and then as root

	make install
