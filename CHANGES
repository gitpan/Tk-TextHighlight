Tk::TextHighlight module changes log

04 august 2007
	Initial release - adding following new features to Tk::CodeText
	(no longer maintained, afaik):
	
	1)  Tk::Text::SuperText - like bracket highlighting / matching with vi-like 
	jump-to-matching bracket (Ctrl-p).

	2)  Added feature to auto-change rules-colors for rules whose color is the same as 
	the background color of the widget (to avoid invisible text).  The color is set to 
	either black or white depending on the brightness of the background color.

	3)  Fixed TextUndo-related bug to allow user to see text as he types past right-edge 
	of screen.

	4)  Added "setRule()" method to allow altering of individual rules by the programmer.

	5)  Modified right-click menu to allow saving of modified rules.

	6)  Added new options:  -noRulesMenu (dont show rules-menu in right-click menu), 
	-noSyntaxMenu, -noRulesEditMenu, -noSaveRulesMenu to prevent the corresponding items 
	from appearing in the right-click menu.  -noPlugInit - disables new feature #8 and 
	behaves as original CodeText.

	7) Fixed small bug w/auto-indenting.

	8) Fixed small bug w/rules-initialization when no .rules file present.
